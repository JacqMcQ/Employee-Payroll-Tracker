# Employee-Payroll-Tracker
Application developed for managers to view and interpret employee data.  

## Introduction:
When clicking on the "add employee" button you are prompted to enter the employee's first and last name as well as their salary. Once all of the employees have been added, the application will return a table containing the list of employees sorted alphabetically by last name. An additional specification was added to sort by first name when the last name is the same. The console will log details pertaining to the data to include the average salary and array of employees.

### Source
AI was used to troubleshoot sorting by employee last names and first names when the last names are the same. AI was also used to assist with the 'salary' property of the employee object to ensure that this holds a numeric valule rather than a string that will be useful in the console when completing mathamatical operations like (average salary).
